# redis-main 

This container is based on the official [Redis Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/redis/).

Its `redis.conf` uses the default/example config file `http://download.redis.io/redis-stable/redis.conf` but binds to any
 address.
 

If you run Redis yourself in production (rather than use a hosted service in your datacenter) make sure you follow their
 [security guidelines](https://redis.io/topics/security).
